- current: working on `SearchResults` & `MovieList`
- feels like repeating when catching `onMovieClick` function and defining its type `SearchResults`
- replace fetch with axios in SearchBar page
- fix env variables issue in MovieDashboard, SearchBar , MovieInfo
- add type safety for the response received from API in Movieinfo Page
